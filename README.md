# CS401FinalProject

For our final project, our team has decided to program an emergency Home Security System with a monitoring (GUI) interface that stores client information and connects home security features to a network to contact emergency services when needed. Our project includes multiple objects that works for a specific part of our alarm system and are connected to the heart of our program i.e. the Monitor. Our system is client-based and the monitor could expand to a huge database system that keeps track of all the information of many clients and their homes. The various services our system provides is a 911-Dispatch, Home-Alarm system, and a simulated News feed. This program is heavily inspired by ADT.
